		/* Else cannot be by itself. It depends on the if 
		statement. You can put anything in the else clause. For example:
	if( 3 + 1 == 4);{
		print("The door is open.");
	} else {
		print("The way is shut. It was made by those who are
		dead, and the dead keep it. The way is shut.");
		}
		
		(In this case, 3 + 1 == 4 is always true, and the if-statement code will always 
		run.)
		I wish I had thought of taking notes like this ages ago.
		
		Operators a symbols that do funtions.
		+ is add
		- is subtract
		/ is divide 
		* is multiply
		= assign value
		== check equality
		!= check for inequality

	/* Notes for Feb 8 

	/* An array is like unto a fence with slats. There can be 
	as many or as few slats as you need. The slats are 
	the same type, but not necessarily the same size.
	
	You can have an array of strings, or an array of 
	floats, but not an array of strings and floats. 
	
	Arrays are declared with the square brackets. So:
	
	string [] players
	
	Counting starts with zero.  */
